# ===================================================================
# .gitignore for Image Generation & Deep Learning Projects
#
# Tailored for researchers using Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow, Diffusers,
# Jupyter Notebooks, and handling large datasets/models.
# ===================================================================

# >> 1. Generated Outputs (VERY IMPORTANT)
# Ignore all directories where you save generated images, grids, or videos.
# This prevents committing thousands of experiment results.
# /outputs/
# /results/
# /samples/
# /generated/
# /images/
# /output/

# >> 2. Datasets and Large Files
# Datasets should NEVER be tracked by Git. Store them in a separate
# data server, cloud storage, or use DVC (Data Version Control).
/datasets/
/data/
/raw_data/
*.zip
*.tar.gz
*.rar
temp
# >> 3. Model Checkpoints & Weights (CRITICAL)
# Model files are often GBs in size. Never commit them.
# Download them on-demand or store them outside the repo.
/models/
/checkpoints/
/weights/
/saved_models/
*.pt
*.pth
*.bin
*.ckpt
*.onnx
*.safetensors

# >> 4. Python & Environment Files
# Ignore virtual environment folders, Python caches, and build artifacts.
/.venv/
/venv/
/env/
/.env
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd
*.egg-info/
/build/
/dist/
/downloads/
/wheels/
*.whl

# >> 5. Logs, Caches, and Experiment Tracking
# Ignore logs, profiling data, and caches from various tools.
# Experiment tracking data (like W&B/TensorBoard) can be large.
/logs/
/log/
/wandb/
/mlruns/
/tensorboard/
*.log
*.prof
*.prof.*
*.out
.cache/
/.cache/
*.torch_compile_cache/

# >> 6. Jupyter Notebook & IDE Configuration
# Ignore notebook checkpoints and IDE-specific setting files.
# It's good practice to commit the .ipynb files, but not their checkpoints.
.ipynb_checkpoints/
.idea/
.vscode/
*.sublime-project
*.sublime-workspace
*.swp

# >> 7. Secrets and Credentials (SECURITY)
# Never commit API keys, tokens, or other secrets.
# Use a .env file (which is ignored above) to manage them.
secrets.yml
secrets.json
config.local.yml
*.pem
*.key
*credentials*

# >> 8. Operating System Specific Files
# Standard OS-generated files.
.DS_Store
.DS_Store?
._*
.Spotlight-V100
.Trashes
